      <h2>Cities Lived In</h2>
        <p>Erie is the town that my mother grew up in, and therefore I lived there with her.
          My father currently lives in Dallas and I enlisted There.
          I am currently living in Colorado Springs working for the Space Force.

      <h2>Would Like To Visit</h2>
        <p>Orlando has Universal and Disney World.
          Seattle is located in the north west US, which I have never been.
          Reno is next to California but is located in Nevada, which is a tax-free state.

              <strong>Orlando: <span>My wife and I visited Disney World once and would like to go back.
                She also has not been to Universal Studios before.</span>
              </strong>
            </li>
            <li>
              <em>Seattle: <span>Seattle is close to the northern border and also has great scenery.
                I would love to go and see the mountains in the area as well as try the food.</span>
              </em>
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Reno: <span>I've heard a lot of good things about Reno but have never been there.
              With it as close to CA as it is, I'd like to scout it as a potential future home town.</span>
